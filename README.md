### Disclaimer(s):
1. Some of these vehicles use drop-in, which is a pain in the arse to set up. If there's no setup video... I'm sorry and good luck.
2. Pictures are sometimes very old and may differ slightly from actual schematics due to some tweaks later on. Taking pictures at <5 FPS with lagspikes is a hassle.
# Some pictures I guess.
